# Gender Classifier

This is a simple gender classifier built using scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of the following features:

- Height (in cm)
- Weight (in kg)
- Shoe size

And the corresponding labels:

- Male
- Female

## Models Used

Four different classification models are employed:

1. Decision Tree
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Random Forest
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Usage

To use the classifier:

1. Install scikit-learn using `pip install scikit-learn`.
2. Run the Python script `gender_classifier.py`.

## Notes

- The dataset used for training and testing is relatively small and might not be representative of real-world scenarios.
- The accuracy scores reported here are based on testing the models on the same data they were trained on. For a more accurate assessment, it's recommended to split the data into training and testing sets.
- This classifier serves as a simple demonstration and may require further refinement and evaluation for practical use cases.
